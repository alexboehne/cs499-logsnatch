## Steps for setting up node server:

1. Make sure node is installed (check nodejs site for instructions)

2. Add Express to the directory with `npm install express`

3. Run `npn init`, only field that matters is the main server entry (default index.js)

4. Create the main server file and configure

5. Run the server with `node (mainfile).js`
